The government has decidedly sped up the process following the restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and this has now become a key pillar to aid the country’s recovery. Digitalisation of public administrations (PAs) and their relations with the country’s citizens and businesses have become the focus of the digital innovation measures contained in the “Simplifications” Decree Law approved by the Prime Minister's Office on 7 July. It is against this backdrop that the four-year investment plan of publicly-owned company PagoPA S.p.A. is receiving strong backing from the European Union’s bank.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
